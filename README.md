This is my second project for CIS3207, Introduction to Operating Systems.
It is a shell, written in C.

Some of the project's requirements are more thoroughly outlined in my report,
but in a few words our shell had to be capable of the following:
  1. executing built-in commands (e.g. ls, echo, help, ...)
  2. executing applications via exec() system calls (e.g. emacs, firefox, ...)
  3. I/O redirection including piping
  4. background execution
